"""
        TIME OF FLIGHT
This sequence involves sending a readout pulse and capturing the raw ADC traces.
The data undergoes post-processing to calibrate three distinct parameters:
    - Time of Flight: This represents the internal processing time and the propagation delay of the readout pulse.
    Its value can be adjusted in the configuration under "time_of_flight".
    This value is utilized to offset the acquisition window relative to when the readout pulse is dispatched.

    - Analog Inputs Offset: Due to minor impedance mismatches, the signals captured by the OPX might exhibit slight offsets.
    These can be rectified in the configuration at: config/controllers/"con1"/analog_inputs, enhancing the demodulation process.

    - Analog Inputs Gain: If a signal is constrained by digitization or if it saturates the ADC,
    the variable gain of the OPX analog input can be modified to fit the signal within the ADC range of +/-0.5V.
    This gain, ranging from -12 dB to 20 dB, can also be adjusted in the configuration at: config/controllers/"con1"/analog_inputs.
